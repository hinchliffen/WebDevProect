Description:
The Spectrum Press Webpage was the final project for our Web Development class at Wentworth Insitiute of Technology. The group decided to create a website for a local business that didn't have one. We hosted the site on Heroku. Site was written in HTML and CSS with a little bit of php for Heroku configuration.
